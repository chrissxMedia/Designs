# Designs
Many designs from chrissx Media and resources for those.

## Dependencies
For rebuilding all of the logos you need the following software packages:
- `make`
- An ANSI Common Lisp implementation (`sbcl` is used by default)
- Inkscape (pre-1.0 versions need custom hacks)
- GIMP

Additionally you need our official fonts:
- [Unifont](http://www.unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html)
- Minecraft (an official source is to be determined)

## A Note on GIMP Scripting
Scripting GIMP is horribly broken (at least on macOS), but thankfully you can use `xcftools`:
```sh
CFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/include LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/lib -lintl" ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make -j8 install
```
But they don't support xcf11â€¦

So you will have to export from GIMP yourself.

## Building
Remove the old build files and run `make`.
Then open up all the GIMP files and export them.

Running `make` might require custom configuration, like with `inkscape` < 1.0:
`INKSCAPE="inkscape -e" make`

Or with other Common Lisp runtimes:
`CL=clisp make`
